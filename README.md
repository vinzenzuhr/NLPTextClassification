# NLP Text Classification
This is a small NLP project where we classified ~5000 hospital reports into 40 classes. 

## Overview
As classifiers we trained a BERT model, some classical machine learning models and tried a zero-shot approach with a GPT-like model. 
To further optimise the performance, we tried different preprocessing steps and did a small amount of parameter tuning.
